# Synthetic Patients Fall 2022 - Fall 2023

Background on synthetic data: 
Synthetic data is generated by applying a sampling technique to real world data where models and processes interact to create new data not directly taken from the real world

Why is it important:
Allows scientists to feed machine learning models to represent any situation. This can reflect “what if?” scenarios.

How can it be used:
It can be deployed to validate mathematical models and train ML models

Pros and cons:
A common problem faced when collecting data corresponding to hospitals and patients through the care process, is that collecting this data does not usually abide by the clinical guidelines and HIPPA laws.



**Goals**
1. Find quality data sets -- Patient data (not population data) with multiple biometric measurements

2. Create synthetic data -- Apply multiple ML techniques for data 

3. Validate data -- Confirm characteristics of parent data, compare ML techniques used

4. Evaluate Data -- Actually use data for tasks such as classification and observe performance
